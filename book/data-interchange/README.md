# Data Interchange

Out of the box, Stof is very helpful for working with interchange data, like JSON, YAML, etc.

* Unified data interface, adding functions, types, and a mutable structure to existing data.
* Acting as an intermediate representation, Stof can transform and control data between systems.
  * Filter data (access control)
  * Rename, restructure, and alter/add types (schema transformations)
  * Orchestrate multiple systems together
  * Import data in one format, transform it as Stof and then export it as another

In this section, we'll dive into interchange data, starting with turning a JSON document into a Stof document.
