description: Embedding Stof in a host language.

# Host Environments

The CLI is used in these docs to keep the focus on Stof rather than on a particular programming language. However, in practice, Stof is most useful when embedded.

This section of the book is dedicated to outlining Stof's use within different host environments.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Contact us](../../resources-and-information.md) if you need an additional environment added to Stof. It's our mission to make Stof useful everywhere.
{% endhint %}
