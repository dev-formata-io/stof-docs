# ðŸ“š CLI Libraries

Stof libraries are dynamic and able to be added, removed, or otherwise modified by the host system.

In addition to the standard [libraries](../../libraries/), the CLI has two system libraries always enabled: file system, and time. It also provides the option to enable a default [HTTP library](https://github.com/dev-formata-io/stof-http).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have specific needs or ideas for the CLI, please submit an issue on our [GitHub](../../../resources-and-information.md) and/or [reach out](../../../resources-and-information.md).
